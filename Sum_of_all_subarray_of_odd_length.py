# The idea is to count the frequency of each element in arr appearing in the sub array, then sum up arr[i]*freq[i]. The key is how to count the freq[i] of each element arr[i]. Actually, freq[i] = freq[i-1]-(i+1)//2+(n-i+1)//2. n is the arr length.

# for example arr = [1,4,2,5,3], element arr[0] = 1. The appearing freq of head element arr[0] should be how many odd-length sub arrays it can generate. The answer is (len(arr)+1)//2. Therefore, the freq of element arr[0] = 1 is (5+1)//2=3.

# Now let's take element arr[1] = 4 for example, if we take element arr[0] = 1 out, then arr[1] = 4 becomes the new head element, thus the freq of arr[1] = 4 in the new subarray could be calculated as the same way of arr[0] = 1. It seems that all we need to do is add the freq of previous element arr[0] up then we get the freq of arr[1].

# No, we also need to minus the subarrays of previous element arr[0] = 1 when they do not include arr[1]=4. In this case, it is [1]. This is why freq[i] = freq[i-1]-(i+1)//2+(n-i+1)//2.

# To sum up, the core idea is to find the relationship between freq_current_element and freq_previous_element.
class Solution:
    def sumOddLengthSubarrays(self, arr: List[int]) -> int:
        # corner case
        
        res = 0; freq = 0; n = len(arr)
        for i in range(n):
            freq = freq-(i+1)//2+(n-i+1)//2
            res += freq*arr[i]
        return res
